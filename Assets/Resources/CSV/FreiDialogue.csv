Conversation 0|when finding phone
Agent Adams|Catherine had Agent Frei's phone in her desk. That's strange.
Agent Frei|Oh thank goodness you found me! You found me! You found me!
Agent Adams|Found you? What do you mean?
Agent Frei|The phone. I'm inside the phone.
Agent Adams|What happened?
Agent Frei|The whistleblower, the liar, the murderer. Don't trust her. Do not trust her.
Agent Frei|Sneaky sneaky. She found a way, found a way to trap my soul.
Agent Adams|Hmm... She must have interfered with the resurrection crystals somehow.
Agent Frei|Get me out. Out. OUT!
Agent Adams|I'll get you out of here. I'm sure the nerds back at headquarters can figure something out for your situation.
Agent Adams|But first I'm going to finish what I started.
