Conversation 0|Beginning of game
Director Wilkins|Let me know when you have made it inside the building.
Agent|I’m in.
Director Wilkins|Good. Keep me updated if you find anything, especially anything related to Agent Frei.
;Conversation 1|After first death
Agent|The employees here are hostile. I can confirm they are using arcane power.
Director Wilkins|Nothing we haven't dealt with before. We have enough power stored from the last arcane being we killed to bring you back when you die.
;Conversation 2|Being Texted by agent frei
Agent|I just got a text from Agent Frei’s phone.
Director Wilkins|Was it him?
Agent|I’m not sure. He seemed to be extremely disoriented. I couldn’t get any straight answers out of him.
;Conversation 3|After finding Agent Frei’s phone
Agent|I found Agent Frei. His soul has been trapped in his phone.
Director Wilkins|How on earth did that happen?
Agent|I don’t know exactly. It seems to have broken his mind. I couldn’t get clear details from him.
Agent|I think the whistleblower killed him and somehow interfered with the resurrection crystals. I also think she’s lying about a lot of stuff. I haven’t found any evidence to support her accusations.
Director Wilkins|Hmm…
Director Wilkins|Continue your investigation. I’m sure you’ll be able to get them on something.
Agent|Yes sir.
