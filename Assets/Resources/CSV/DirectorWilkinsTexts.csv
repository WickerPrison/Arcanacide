Conversation 0|Beginning of game
Director Wilkins|Let me know when you have made it inside the building.
Agent|Iâ€™m in.
Director Wilkins|Good. Keep me updated if you find anything, especially anything related to Agent Frei.
;Conversation 1|After first death
Agent|The employees here are hostile. I can confirm they are using arcane power.
Director Wilkins|Nothing we haven't dealt with before. We have enough power stored from the last arcane being we killed to bring you back when you die.
;Conversation 2|After finding first resurrection crystals
Agent|I found some resurrection crystals placed by Agent Frei. Still no sign of him.
Director Wilkins|Interesting.
Director Wilkins|If he employed resurrection crystals and still didn't make it out alive then there must be something truly dangerous there.
