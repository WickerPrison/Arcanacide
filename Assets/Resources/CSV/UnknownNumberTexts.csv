Unknown Number|East is up.
Agent|I’m not familiar with this code phrase. Who are you?
Unknown Number|It has been a long time Agent Adams. I hear you reached the rank of Special Agent. Congrats.
Unknown Number|I had that rank once. The badge, the reputation, the magic sword.
Unknown Number|But then I saw the corruption. The bribes, the blackmail, the magic sword.
Unknown Number|Have you seen the corruption, Agent?
Agent|Ah. You’re one of those. Please do not contact me again.
;Conversation 1|Somewhere on the 3rd floor
Unknown Number|Do you really want to spend your life serving an organization you know is corrupt?
Agent|I really couldn’t care less. If you message me again I will block you.
Unknown Number|What if I told you I know what really happened to your last partner?
Unknown Number|This number has been blocked.
