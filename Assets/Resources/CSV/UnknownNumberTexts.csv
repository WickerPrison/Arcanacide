Unknown Number|East is up.
Agent|I’m not familiar with this code phrase. Who are you?
Unknown Number|It has been a long time Agent Adams. I hear you reached the rank of Special Agent. Congrats.
Unknown Number|I had that rank once. The badge, the reputation, the magic sword.
Unknown Number|But then I saw the corruption. The bribes, the blackmail, the magic sword.
Unknown Number|Have you seen the corruption, Agent?
Agent|Ah. You’re one of those. Please do not contact me again.
