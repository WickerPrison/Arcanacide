Conversation 0|First time meeting
Agent Adams|You don't seem to be corrupted by the arcane powers here.
Ernie|Nope. It'll take more than a little magic to mess with this old brain of mine. 
Ernie|I figured we'd be seeing someone like you after what happened to the last agent they sent.
Agent Adams|Do you know what happened to him?
Ernie|Some fool here killed him. You'll find his body on the third floor.
Ernie|Let me impart some of my power to you. There's enough that needs cleaning around here without adding your corpse to the list.
;Conversation 1|Repeatable on 1st floor
Ernie|How's that shield working for you? Hopefully it will keep you alive.
;Conversation 2|Meet on 2nd floor
Ernie|Ah, there you are. I see you've made good use of that shield I gave you.
Agent Adams|Yes, it has been most useful.
Ernie|I have something else to give you as long as you do one thing for me.
Agent Adams|What is it?
Ernie|When you are done on the second floor, go stop whatever it is that is causing all this water to drip down from the third floor. Puddles are forming faster than I can clean them up.
Agent Adams|No problem.
;Conversation 3|Repeatable on 2nd floor
Ernie|Go stop whoever is causing all this water to drip down from the floor above us.
;Conversation 4|Meet on 2nd floor
Ernie|I noticed you've picked up some of those patches that started this whole mess.
Agent Adams|Yeah, they've been very useful so far.
Ernie|I'll expand your capacity for using them. But you should still be careful, those things can really mess with a person's mind.
;Conversation 5|Repeatable on 3rd floor
Ernie|Be careful out there.
