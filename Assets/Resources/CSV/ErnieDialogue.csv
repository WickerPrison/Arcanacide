Conversation 0|First time meeting
Agent Adams|You don't seem to be corrupted by the arcane powers here.
Ernie|Nope. I wasn’t stupid or desperate enough to accept the Arcane Benefits Package they offered me. 
Ernie|I figured we'd be seeing someone like you after what happened to the last agent they sent.
Agent Adams|Do you know what happened to him?
Ernie|Some fool here killed him. You'll find his body on the third floor.
Ernie|Let me impart some of my power to you. There's enough that needs cleaning around here without adding your corpse to the list.
Ernie|Talk to me again if you ever want to change where you have allocated your power. I can reset you back to a clean slate.
;Conversation 1|Repeatable on 1st floor
Ernie|How's that shield working for you? Hopefully it will keep you alive.
Ernie|Do you want me to reset your levels?
;Conversation 2|Meet on 2nd floor
Agent Adams|Hey Ernie, I have a question for you. With everything going on here, why haven’t you left?
Ernie|Eh, this isn’t that bad. You should have seen my last job.
Agent Adams|What was your last job?
Ernie|You could say I was a janitor. I try not to dwell on the past too much.
Ernie|Actually, I have a memento from my past that I’ve been trying to get rid of that I think you would appreciate.
;Conversation 3|Repeatable on 2nd floor
Ernie|Do you want me to clean up your powers?
;Conversation 4|Meet on 3rd floor
Ernie|I noticed you've picked up some of those patches that started this whole mess.
Agent Adams|Yeah, they've been very useful so far.
Ernie|I'll expand your capacity for using them. But you should still be careful, those things can really mess with a person's mind.
Agent Adams|How do you know how to do things like that?
Ernie|My last job came with a hefty benefits package similar to the one Patchwork Gary sold to this company’s CEO. When I realized the effect the magic was having on my mind I quit.
Ernie|Really, you’re doing me a favor by taking this power off my hands.
;Conversation 5|Repeatable on 3rd floor
Ernie|Do you want me to clean up your powers?
;Conversation 6|Meet on 5th floor
Ernie|You made to the top floor, now you just have to find the CEO. He's quite powerful, I'll expand your capacity for using patches again.
;Conversation 7|Repeatable on 5th floor
Ernie|Try not to get lost. Geometry doesn't seem to work quite right on this floor.
Ernie|Do you want me to clean up your powers?
