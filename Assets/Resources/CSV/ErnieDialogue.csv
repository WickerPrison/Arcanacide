Conversation 0|First time meeting
Agent Adams|You don't seem to be corrupted by the arcane powers here.
Ernie|Nope. It'll take more than a little magic to mess with this old brain of mine. 
Ernie|I figured we'd be seeing someone like you after what happened to the last agent they sent.
Agent Adams|Do you know what happened to him?
Ernie|Some fool here killed him. You'll find his body on the second floor.
Ernie|Let me impart some of my power to you. There's enough that needs cleaning around here without adding your corpse to the list.
;Conversation 1|Repeatable on 1st floor
Ernie|How's that shield working for you? Hopefully it will keep you alive.
