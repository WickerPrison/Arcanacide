Catherine Pope|Don’t hurt me, I’m not corrupted by that magic like they are.
Agent Adams|Who are you?
Catherine Pope|My name is Catherine, I’m the whistleblower that tipped you off to this whole situation. 
Agent Adams|Do you know what happened to the last agent they sent to investigate?
Catherine Pope|Last agent?
Catherine Pope|I didn’t know they had already sent someone.
Agent Adams|Hmm… That’s strange.
Agent Adams|What can you tell me about what is going on here?
Catherine Pope|The company has been struggling for a while. The CEO brought in a string of contractors to try to solve it but nothing worked.
Catherine Pope|Eventually the head of accounting, the head of HR, and the CEO devised a plan.
Catherine Pope|They began trading in all kinds of illegal goods... guns, drugs, you name it.
Agent Adams|Did they report those sales as taxable income?
Catherine Pope|No.
Agent Adams|Then I can’t let this stand for one moment longer.
Catherine Pope|This floor is the IT department. Nobody on this floor was involved in the criminal behavior.
Agent Adams|We’ll see about that. I have a warrant to search the whole building.
;Conversation 1|
Catherine Pope|You won’t be able to talk to the head of IT unless you file a support ticket first. He’s very adamant about that.
;Conversation 2|2nd floor
Catherine Pope|The head of HR's office is right through this door. They put her office right next to the generator room because she likes to blast anime theme songs while she works.
Agent Adams|They do tend to be bangers.
Agent Adams|I have searched this floor and I didn’t find any evidence of the guns or drugs that you mentioned earlier.
Catherine Pope|Oh… umm…
Catherine Pope|That makes sense because it was mostly the head of accounting that was doing it, Carol was just helping to cover it up.
Agent Adams|…
Catherine Pope|I’m sure you’ll find the evidence you’re looking for in her office.
Agent Adams|I’m sure I will.

Catherine Pope|Good luck against Carol. I hear her sword is made of steel folded 10,000 times and can cut through other swords like butter.
Agent Adams|I’m pretty sure that’s not how it works.
