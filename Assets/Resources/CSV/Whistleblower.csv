Catherine Pope|Don’t hurt me, I’m not corrupted by that magic like they are.
Agent Adams|Who are you?
Catherine Pope|My name is Catherine, I’m the whistleblower that tipped you off to this whole situation. 
Agent Adams|Do you know what happened to the last agent they sent to investigate?
Catherine Pope|Last agent?
Catherine Pope|I didn’t know they had already sent someone.
Agent Adams|Hmm… That’s strange.
Agent Adams|What can you tell me about what is going on here?
Catherine Pope|The company has been struggling for a while. The CEO brought in a string of contractors to try to solve it but nothing worked.
Catherine Pope|Eventually the head of accounting, the head of HR, and the CEO devised a plan.
Catherine Pope|They began trading in all kinds of illegal goods... guns, drugs, you name it.
Agent Adams|Did they report those sales as taxable income?
Catherine Pope|No.
Agent Adams|Then I can’t let this stand for one moment longer.
Catherine Pope|This floor is the IT department. Nobody on this floor was involved in the criminal behavior.
Agent Adams|We’ll see about that. I have a warrant to search the whole building.
;Conversation 1|
Catherine Pope|You won’t be able to talk to the head of IT unless you file a support ticket first. He’s very adamant about that.
;Conversation 2|2nd floor
Catherine Pope|Careful! Carol, the head of HR, has her office on the other side of this door. 
Agent Adams|Perfect, I will head in there right now and talk to her.
Catherine Pope|I would advise against that. She will not comply with your audit and she has the Power of Friendship making her stronger.
Catherine Pope|Fortunately, I have a plan for how you can defeat the Power of Friendship.
Catherine Pope|Her three best friends all work on this floor. You can recognize them because they are stronger than the other employees and they have Friendship Halos made of lightning.
Catherine Pope|I have written down exactly what you should say to each of them to destroy their friendship with Carol.
Agent Adams|You have this very well thought out.
Catherine Pope|Each friendship you destroy will weaken Carol. I recommend destroying 1 or 2 of them before facing Carol.
Agent Adams|Nobody has ever voluntarily aided the IRS this much since its founding in 1913. We keep track of things like that.
;Conversation 3|
Catherine Pope|Good luck against Carol. Her sword is made of steel folded 10,000 times and can cut through other swords like butter.
Agent Adams|That’s not how swords work.
;Conversation 4|4th floor
Agent Adams|You’ve been lying to me. None of the crimes you told us about were real and I have reason to believe you were involved in the death of an IRS agent.
Catherine Pope|That is preposterous! I would never do such things!
Agent Adams|You are under arrest for the murder of IRS Agent Frei.
