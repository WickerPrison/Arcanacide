Catherine Pope|Don’t hurt me, I’m not corrupted by the magic like they are.
Agent Adams|Who are you?
Catherine Pope|My name is Catherine, I’m the whistleblower that tipped you off to this whole situation. 
Agent Adams|Do you know what happened to the last agent they sent to investigate?
Catherine Pope|Last agent?
Catherine Pope|I didn’t know they had already sent someone.
Agent Adams|Hmm… That’s strange.
Agent Adams|What can you tell me about what is going on here?
Catherine Pope|The company has been struggling for a while. The CEO brought in a string of contractors to try to solve it but nothing worked.
Catherine Pope|Eventually the head of accounting, the head of HR, and the CEO devised a plan.
Catherine Pope|They began trading in all kinds of illegal goods... guns, drugs, you name it.
Agent Adams|Did they report those sales as taxable income?
Catherine Pope|No.
Agent Adams|Then I can’t let this stand for one moment longer.
Catherine Pope|This floor is the IT department. Nobody on this floor was involved in the criminal behavior.
Agent Adams|We’ll see about that. I have a warrant to search the whole building.

Catherine Pope|You won’t be able to talk to the head of IT unless you file a support ticket first. He’s very adamant about that.
