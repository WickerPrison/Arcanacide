;Conversation 1|Coverup
Agent Adams|There’s a memo here from the CEO to the head of the Accounting department. It says,
Agent Adams|“Frank, you really need to get it together man. We just got another HR complaint from Catherine.”
Agent Adams|“I can’t keep protecting you for much longer. We’ve been friends for years and I honestly don’t think I could keep this company afloat without you.”
Agent Adams|“But if you don’t start treating your employees better immediately I’ll have no choice but to fire you.”
;Conversation 2|Receipts
Agent Adams|I found receipts from personal purchases made by the head of Accounting.
Agent Adams|This guy had an industrial strength air conditioning unit installed at his home. His utilities bill must be unbelievable. 
Agent Adams|How does someone afford AC like that in this economy?
;Conversation 3|Wife Note
Agent Adams|Its a note from the wife of the employee I just fought. It says,
Agent Adams|“I’m worried about you. Ever since you got this new job you’ve been acting distant and cold.”
Agent Adams|“I know this job pays well and has good benefits, but I’m worried it is changing you into something you’re not.”
Agent Adams|“I love you.”
