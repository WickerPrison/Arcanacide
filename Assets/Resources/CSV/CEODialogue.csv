CEO|You don’t understand. I had to do it. Do you know how many people I’m responsible for? I couldn’t let this company fail, I couldn’t let my employees lose everything because of my mistakes.
Agent Adams|Relax, I’m just here to do an audit. Hand over your tax information. Everything will be fine… unless you haven’t been paying your taxes.
CEO|Oh… Really? Of course I pay my taxes, I’ll have my assistant get you the documents you need.
Assistant|Actually sir, you haven’t been the same since gaining magical powers. You’ve been acting irrational. 
Assistant|You… haven’t been paying your taxes.
Agent Adams|So it is true. I’m afraid I have to arrest you.
CEO|No, I won’t let this happen! You’ll never take me alive! Assistant, kill him!
