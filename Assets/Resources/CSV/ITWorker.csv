Conversation 0|First Meeting
Agent Adams|You aren’t trying to kill me?
IT Worker|Oh… right…. I was supposed to do that today.
IT Worker|I have too much to do. I’ll try to get to that tomorrow.
IT Worker|This hallway is blocked off by this Wall of Fire and I can’t get the Fire Suppression System working.
Agent Adams|Have you tried turning it off and on again?
IT Worker|I see you have some IT experience.
IT Worker|But no. The power switch is on the other end of this hall. If you find yourself over there, I would be mighty appreciative if you did that for me.
Agent Adams|I’ll see what I can do.
;Conversation 1|Repeatable
IT Worker|There’s a large power switch on the other end of this hallway. If you see it, try turning it off and then on again for me.
;Conversation 2|After fixing
IT Worker|Thanks for dealing with those Walls of Fire. I’ll just be packing up and then heading out.
