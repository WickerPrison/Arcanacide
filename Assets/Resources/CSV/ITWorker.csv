Conversation 0|First Meeting
Agent Adams|You aren't trying to kill me?
IT Worker|Oh... right.. I was supposed to do that today.
IT Worker|I have too much to do. I'll try to get to that tomorrow.
IT Worker|This hallway is blocked off by this Wall of Fire and I can't get the Fire Suppression System working.
Agent Adams|Have you tried turning it off and on again?
IT Worker|I see you have some IT experience.
IT Worker|But no. The power switch is on the other end of this hall. If you find yourself over there, I would be mighty appreciative if you did that for me.
Agent Adams|I'll see what I can do.
;Conversation 1|Repeatable
IT Worker|There's a large power switch on the other end of this hallway. If you see it, try turning it off and then on again for me.
;Conversation 2|After fixing
IT Worker|Thanks for dealing with those Walls of Fire. I'll just be packing up and then heading out.
;Conversation 3|3rd floor greeting
IT Worker|Oh... hi. You're the one that helped me get that firewall fixed back on the first floor, right?
Agent Adams|I am. Now I'm looking for the head of this department, is this his office?
IT Worker|Yes, but he hasn't been here since the AC in here broke.
Agent Adams|Have you tried turning it off and on again?
IT Worker|Yes, but that didn't work. I think somebody intentionally sabotaged it.
IT Worker|If you're trying to get to Frank you'll need this.
;Conversation 4|Repeatable
IT Worker|I do have orders to kill you, but I'll get to that once this AC is fixed.
;Conversation 5|In front of Frank
IT Worker|Oh... Hi there. Frank, the Head of Accounting is just through this door. I was about to go in there and tell him that I can't fix the AC in his office. 
IT Worker|Partially because it was intentionally sabotaged, and partially because I do IT and have no idea how to fix an AC unit.
Agent Adams|Why are you just waiting outside the door?
IT Worker|Frank doesn't usually take bad news very well. He has been known to turn people who fail him into mindless ice golems.
IT Worker|Do you want to go first? Who knows, maybe you'll kill him and I won't have to deal with this.
;Conversation 6|Repeatable
IT Worker|You go first... Frank scares me.
;Conversation 7|4th floor
IT Worker|Thanks for talking to Frank for me. I was not looking forward to that conversation.
IT Worker|You've been very helpful today, I only have a few things left on my to do list. Could you help me one more time?
Agent Adams|What do you want me to do?
IT Worker|I'm fixing a thing here, but the employees on this floor keep forgetting their passwords. Arcane powers really turn your mind to mush.
IT Worker| If you could help me reset them to something more memorable, I'm thinking something like '1234'.
Agent Adams|You're not very security conscious are you?
IT Worker|Oh, right. Good point. 
IT Worker|Do you promise not to snoop around on their computer when changing their password?
Agent Adams|I give my word as a representative of the federal government.
IT Worker|Good enough for me.
Agent Adams|Mush is putting it lightly.
IT Worker|What?
Agent Adams|Nothing. How do I access these computers?
IT Worker|There are four computers that need their passwords reset. Here are the instructions you'll need when you find them.
;Conversation 8|Repeatable
IT Worker|When you're done with resetting those passwords, come back here. There is one final thing on my to do list.
;Conversation 9|final
IT Worker|Thanks for all your help today. There is only one thing left on my to do list.
Agent Adams|Killing me?
IT Worker|Killing you.
Agent Adams|Couldn't you put that off till tomorrow?
IT Worker|Nope.
