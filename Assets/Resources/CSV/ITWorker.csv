Conversation 0|First Meeting
Agent Adams|You aren't trying to kill me?
IT Worker|Oh... righ... I was supposed to do that today.
IT Worker|I have too much to do. I'll try to get to that tomorrow.
IT Worker|This hallway is blocked off by this Wall of Fire and I can't get the Fire Suppression System working.
Agent Adams|Have you tried turning it off and on again?
IT Worker|I see you have some IT experience.
IT Worker|But no. The power switch is on the other end of this hall. If you find yourself over there, I would be mighty appreciative if you did that for me.
Agent Adams|I'll see what I can do.
;Conversation 1|Repeatable
IT Worker|There's a large power switch on the other end of this hallway. If you see it, try turning it off and then on again for me.
;Conversation 2|After fixing
IT Worker|Thanks for dealing with those Walls of Fire. I'll just be packing up and then heading out.
;Conversation 3|3rd floor greeting
IT Worker|Oh... hi. You're the one that helped me get that firewall fixed back on the first floor, right?
Agent Adams|I am. Now I'm looking for the head of this department, is this his office?
IT Worker|Yes, but he hasn't been here since the AC in here broke.
Agent Adams|Have you tried turning it off and on again?
IT Worker|Yes, but that didn't work. I think somebody intentionally sabatoged it.
IT Worker|If you're trying to get to Frank you'll need this.
;Conversation 4|Repeatable
IT Worker|I do have orders to kill you, but I'll get to that once this AC is fixed.
;Conversation 5|In front of Frank
IT Worker|Oh... Hi there. Frank, the Head of Accounting is just through this door. I was about to go in there and tell him that I can't fix the AC in his office. 
IT Worker|Partially because it was intentionally sabatoged, and partially because I do IT and have no idea how to fix an AC unit.
Agent Adams|Why are you just waiting outside the door?
IT Worker|Frank doesn't usually take bad news very well. He has been known to turn people who fail him into mindless ice golems.
IT Worker|Do you want to go first? Who knows, maybe you'll kill him and I won't have to deal with this.
;Conversation 6|Repeatable
IT Worker|You go first... Frank scares me.
