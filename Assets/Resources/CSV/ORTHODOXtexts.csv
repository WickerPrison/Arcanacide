;Conversation 1|After first death
Agent|The employees here are hostile. I can confirm they are using arcane power.
ORTHODOX|Nothing we haven't dealt with before. We have enough power stored from the last arcane being we killed to bring you back when you die.
ORTHODOX|Have you found any evidence of the previous agent?
Agent|Nothing so far.
ORTHODOX|Keep me updated.
;Conversation 2|After interacting with head of IT
Agent|It's not just the CEO we have to worry about. I think the head of the IT department also needs to be taken down.
ORTHODOX|Very well.
