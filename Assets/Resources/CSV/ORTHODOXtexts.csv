Agent|I'm in.
ORTHODOX|Your primary objective is arresting the CEO. However, you should also collect any evidence you find against the head of each department.
ORTHODOX|You are the second agent we have sent to arrest the CEO. The first one never made it out. Keep an eye out for any evidence of his whereabouts. 
ORTHODOX|There is a whistleblower that has been given the codename TRENCH. Contact him for more information.
;Conversation 1|After first death
Agent|The employees here are hostile. I can confirm they are using arcane power.
ORTHODOX|Nothing we haven't dealt with before. We have enough power stored from the last arcane being we killed to bring you back when you die.
