Patchwork Gary|I sure hope you're not here to arrest me. I'm just an outside contractor.
Agent Adams|As long as you pay your taxes, I don't care who you are.
Patchwork Gary|In that case, I'm called Patchwork Gary. I sell access to arcane powers in the form of magical patches.
Patchwork Gary|Would you be interested in purchasing some?
;Conversation 1|Repeatable greeting
Patchwork Gary|Hello there! I see those fools with hammers haven't managed to squash you yet.
Patchwork Gary|I have some interesting patches if you're in the market for 'em. Care to take a look?
;Conversation 2|Goodbye
Patchwork Gary|Goodbye then. Stay safe friend.
;Conversation 3|2nd floor first time talking
Patchwork Gary|Hello Agent. I see you were able to defeat the head of IT. 
Agent Adams|Yes. Do you by chance happen to know how he got his powers?
Patchwork Gary|Of course I do. The CEO bought our Gold Tier Management Bundle, powers for you and up to 4 subordinates for no additional cost.
Patchwork Gary|Don't give me that look, Agent. There are no laws prohibiting the sale of arcane powers.
Agent Adams|True. However, you will strip all remaining employees of their powers or I will arrest you for interfering with my investigation.
Patchwork Gary|No can do. Once I sell someone powers, I can't do anything to remove them. Also, I doubt the IRS wants to end up in court with the organization I work for.
Agent Adams|Fair enough.
Patchwork Gary|Anyways. I have a new set of Patches for sale, if you want to take a look.
;Conversation 4|2nd floor repeatable greeting
Patchwork Gary|Take a look at my wares. See if there's anything that interests you.
;Conversation 5|2nd floor farewell
Patchwork Gary|I'll see you later then.
;Conversation 6 |3rd floor first time talking
Agent Adams|You wouldn't happen to have anything to help deal with the cold would you?
Patchwork Gary|Unfortunately not. You may want to go searching for the thermostat. That cold is brutal.
Agent Adams|I assume you have more Patches for sale?
Patchwork Gary|Right your are.
;Conversation 7|3rd floor alternate first time talking
Patchwork Gary|Was it you that turned off the AC?
Agent Adams|It was.
Patchwork Gary|Thank you friend, that was getting downright unbearable.
Patchwork Gary|I'd be careful though, I hear the Head of Accounting doesn't like it when people touch the thermostat.
Agent Adams|I think I can handle it.
;Conversation 8|3rd floor repeatable greeting
Agent Adams|Gary.
Patchwork Gary|Agent.
;Conversation 9|3rd floor farewell
Patchwork Gary|Be seeing you.
