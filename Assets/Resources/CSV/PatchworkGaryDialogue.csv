Patchwork Gary|I sure hope you're not here to arrest me. I'm just an outside contractor.
Agent Adams|As long as you pay your taxes, I don't care who you are.
Patchwork Gary|In that case, I'm called Patchwork Gary. I sell access to arcane powers in the form of magical patches.
Patchwork Gary|Would you be interested in purchasing some?
;Conversation 1|Repeatable greeting
Patchwork Gary|Hello there! I see those fools with hammers haven't managed to squash you yet.
Patchwork Gary|I have some interesting patches if you're in the market for 'em. Care to take a look?

Patchwork Gary|Goodbye then. Stay safe friend.
