Conversation 0|Beginning of game
Agent|I'm in.
ODPARCHMENT|Good. Contact the whistleblower for more information, codename: ODTRENCH.
;Conversation 1|After first death
Agent|The employees here are hostile. They also seem to be drawing power from an arcane being.
ODPARCHMENT|Nothing our division hasn't dealt with before. We have enough arcane energy stored from the last arcane being we killed to bring you back when you die. But those reserves won't last forever.
ODPARCHMENT|Have you found any evidence of the previous agent?
Agent|Nothing so far.
ODPARCHMENT|Keep me updated.
;Conversation 2|After interacting with head of IT
Agent|It's not just the CEO we have to worry about. I think the head of the IT department also needs to be taken down.
ODPARCHMENT|Very well.
