Conversation 0 |After talking to ODPARCHMENT the first time
Agent|This is the agent ODPARCHMENT said would contact you. I need a situation report.
ODTRENCH|The one who started all this is the CEO. You'll find him on the fourth floor.
ODTRENCH|Be careful though, it seems like almost everyone here has some sort of crime they want to keep hidden from you. Getting to the fourth floor might be difficult.
Agent|Don't worry about me. Keep yourself safe and contact me with any new information you find.

ODTRENCH|To get to the second floor you'll have to get past the head of the IT department, but he won't talk to anyone unless they file a support ticket first.
ODTRENCH|I know there is a computer somewhere on the first floor where you can file a ticket, but I'm not sure where.
