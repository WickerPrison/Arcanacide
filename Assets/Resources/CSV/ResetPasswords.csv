Agent Adams|"Man, I hate working here lately. The CEO keeps wanting to talk to me but I can never find his office. Doors seem to randomly take me to different places each time."
Agent Adams|"I know, it's getting worse. But it's actually not random. Some doors just lead to different locations depending on which direction you go through them."

Agent Adams|Done. Now I should see arcane runes around the doors that will lead me to his office.
