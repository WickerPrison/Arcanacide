Agent Adams|While I'm resetting this password, let's see what else I can find.
Agent Adams|Ah... Here is a text conversation between two execs that might help me navigate this floor.
Agent Adams|"Man, I hate working here lately. The CEO keeps wanting to talk to me but I can never find his office. Doors seem to randomly take me to different places each time."
Agent Adams|"I know, it's getting worse. But it's actually not random. Some doors just lead to different locations depending on which direction you go through them."
Agent Adams|"I also noticed the doors that do that mess with the gravity in those rooms. So look for floating objects."

Agent Adams|Oh, this is useful. They made an app that directs you to the CEO's office. I'll go ahead and download that.
Agent Adams|Done. Now I should see arcane runes around the doors that will lead me to his office.

Agent Adams|I bet this computer has valuable information on it yet. Too bad I don't have a way to access it right now.
