Frei|Did you come here to rescue me? :-)
Agent|Agent Frei? You’re alive?
Agent|Yes, I am here to rescue you
Frei|What?! Why wouldn’t you try to rescue me?! :’-(
Agent|Are you OK? Where are you?
Frei|It’s hard to say, I would have to guess at least a few days. :-/
Agent|What is going on? You seem off.
