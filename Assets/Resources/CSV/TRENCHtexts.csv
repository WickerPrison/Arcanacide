Conversation 0 |After talking to ORTHODOX the first time
Agent|This is the agent ORTHODOX said would contact you. I need a situation report.
TRENCH|The one who started all this is the CEO. You'll find him on the fourth floor.
TRENCH|Be careful though, most of the employees here are extremely loyal to the CEO. Getting to the fourth floor might be difficult.
Agent|Don't worry about me. Keep yourself safe and contact me with any new information you find.
;Conversation 1|After getting to the 2nd hub
TRENCH|To get to the second floor you'll have to get past the head of the IT department, but he won't talk to anyone unless they file a support ticket first.
TRENCH|I know there is a computer somewhere on the first floor where you can file a ticket, but I'm not sure where.
Agent|I'll find it.
