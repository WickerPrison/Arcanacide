Conversation 0 |After talking to ORTHODOX the first time
Agent|This is Agent Adams. I am currently inside the building what information can you give me?
TRENCH|If you're looking for the CEO, he's on the fourth floor. However, you'll have to get past the head of the IT department on the first floor.
TRENCH|Be careful though, most of the employees here are extremely loyal to the CEO. Getting to the fourth floor might be difficult.
Agent|Don't worry about me. Keep yourself safe and contact me with any new information you find.

TRENCH|To get to the second floor you'll have to get past the head of the IT department, but he won't talk to anyone unless they file a support ticket first.
TRENCH|I know there is a computer somewhere on the first floor where you can file a ticket, but I'm not sure where.
Agent|I'll find it.
